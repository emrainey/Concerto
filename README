Concerto is a simple 1 pass Makefile system. 

When you want to use Concerto, simply create a Makefile at the top of you project, and enter this inside it:

include $(CONCERTO_FOLDER)/rules.mak

Individual Concerto Build sub-makefiles look like this:

_MODULE=<optional module name>
include $(PRELUDE)
TARGET=<name of the object created>
TARGETTYPE=<exe|library|dsmo|prebuilt|jar>
CSOURCES=<list of C files>
CPPSOURCES=<list of C++ files>
ASSEMBLY=<list of .S Files>
IDIRS+=<include directories>
DEFS+=<defines>
STATIC_LIBS=<static libraries within the build system>
SHARED_LIBS=<shared libraries within the build system>
SYS_STATIC_LIBS=<static libraries outside the build system>
SYS_SHARED_LIBS=<shared libraries outside the build system>
include $(FINALE)

You can then modify target.mak to reflect the specific needs of you build system.
